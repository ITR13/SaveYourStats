# SaveYourStats
Game done for Continue? game jam.
[Playable on Itch](https://itr.itch.io/saveyourstats)  

The code is not sustainable, and is written so I can quickly add features short-term. This means that some parts will become really difficult to add features to in the future, but because I didn't have any plans to work on the game after the 2 days of the gamejam it works out.
